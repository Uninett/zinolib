Python library to connect to zino data and notification channel

This module implements almost every functionality that Zino exports via the data and notification channel.

Split from internal project PyRitz on 2023-03-23.


Testing
=======

This library is testable with unittests,
When testing it starts a Zino emulator that reponds correctly to requests as the real server would do.

Test with current python:

```python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/```

If you have all currently supported pythons in your path, you can test them
all, with an HTML coverage report placed in `htmlcov/`:

```tox```

To test on a specific python other than current, run:

```tox -e py{version}```

where `version` is of the form "311" for Python 3.11.
